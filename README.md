# Defining Dynamic Soil Property and Soil Health Reference Conditions for Soil Survey

This repo contains the R code and most data needed to calculate total soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks from the Dynamic Soil Properties for Soil Health v.1.0 database, and generate tables and figures from Dynarski, K.A.; Wills, S.A.; Carter, T.; Adeleke, E.; Kandanool, D.; and Veum, K.S. Defining Dynamic Soil Property and Soil Health Reference Conditions for Soil Survey. In preparation for Soil Advances (2025). 

To run the code, you will also need to download the DSP4SH v.1.0 database (https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/25122323.v1) and save in the /data_raw folder. 

To clean data, calculate SOC stocks, and generate data files for downstream analysis, run code/01_main.R. To run analyses and generate tables and figures displayed in the manuscript,
